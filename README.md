Palindrome Checker


My first ever project, built entirely by myself and from scratch.

Note 1: I will update this repository once I have added the functionality of a dark/light mode theme switcher
Note 2: The app is functional. However, there is one small issue. The results are neatly displayed, each on a separte line. However, if you refresh the page the results are still there, but next to each other. Will try to fix that too.
